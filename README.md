# COVID-19 in Sweden dashboard: Cases, ICU Admissions, Deaths

Plotly Dash dashboard containing graphs displaying the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, admissions to intensive care units, and deaths due to COVID-19 in Sweden. The dashboard is based on open data shared by the Swedish Public Health Agency (Folkh√§lsomyndigheten) between February 2020 and March 2023. There are two filtering options: by date and by county (region).

The live dashboard can be found here: [c19-sweden.serve.scilifelab.se](https://c19-sweden.serve.scilifelab.se/).

## How the dashboard is built
